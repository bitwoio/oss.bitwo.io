<h2 id="tech-stack"> üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack </h2>

Our website is built using the robust Nuxt 3 framework, styled with the versatile TailwindCSS. We're harnessing the power of various Nuxt 3 modules like `sitemap`, `seo`, and `i18n` to enhance our site's functionality. Currently, we have no backend; the site is static and powered by Nuxt's capabilities.

<h2 id="what-is-oss"> üåç What is OSS? </h2>
Open Source Software (OSS) refers to software that's released with a license allowing its source code to be viewed, modified, and distributed. It fosters collaboration, transparency, and community-driven innovation.
